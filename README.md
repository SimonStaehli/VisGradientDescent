# ivi_PerformanceRecord

This repository is for the study course "Interactive Visualizations" and the performance record we have to write for to finish this course.
I've chosen to visualize the Vanilla Gradient Descent Algorithm as a visualization for the this small project.

## Getting started

**Parameters and Workflow:**
- Starting Points: Set your individual starting point(Range: -2 to 2)
- Choose a built-in Function 
- Choose a learning rate for the steps of the gradient

If you have chosen your individual settings for the gradient descnet you can control the gradient with buttons in the box below the box with the parameters.

Have Fun!
